\title{Export Geospatial Data and Regional Metrics to MongoDB}
\usage{
export_geos()
}
\value{
None (invisible). Creates and uploads data to three MongoDB collections:
  - Regional boundary geometries (with 2dsphere index)
  - Regional time series metrics (currency-converted)
  - PDS track grid summaries
}
\description{
Downloads and processes geospatial data from two sources (Kenya and Zanzibar),
harmonizes their structures, applies currency conversions to regional time series
metrics, and exports all data to MongoDB collections with appropriate indexing.
}
\details{
This function performs several key operations:

**Geospatial Data Processing:**
1. Downloads GeoJSON files for Kenya and Zanzibar regions from cloud storage
2. Reads and combines the regional boundary data into a single dataset
3. Uploads combined geospatial data to MongoDB with 2dsphere indexing for spatial queries

**Regional Metrics Processing:**
4. Downloads monthly summary parquet files for both countries from cloud storage
5. Applies currency conversion factors to monetary metrics:
   - Zanzibar: multiplies values by 0.00037 (TZS to USD conversion)
   - Kenya: multiplies values by 0.0077 (KES to USD conversion)
6. Converts the following monetary fields: mean_rpue, mean_rpua, mean_price_kg
7. Uploads regional metrics to MongoDB without geospatial indexing

**PDS Track Grid Processing:**
8. Downloads PDS track grid summaries from cloud storage
9. Uploads grid summaries to a separate MongoDB collection

The function requires appropriate configuration parameters for cloud storage access
and MongoDB connection details, typically loaded via `read_config()`.
