\title{Preprocess Track Data into Spatial Grid Summary}
\usage{
preprocess_track_data(data, grid_size = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing GPS track data with columns:
- Trip: Unique trip identifier
- Time: Timestamp of the GPS point
- Lat: Latitude
- Lng: Longitude
- Speed (M/S): Speed in meters per second
- Range (Meters): Range in meters
- Heading: Heading in degrees}

\item{grid_size}{Numeric. Size of grid cells in meters. Must be one of:
- 100: ~100m grid cells
- 250: ~250m grid cells
- 500: ~500m grid cells (default)
- 1000: ~1km grid cells}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
  - Trip: Trip identifier
  - lat_grid: Latitude of grid cell center
  - lng_grid: Longitude of grid cell center
  - time_spent_mins: Total time spent in grid cell in minutes
  - mean_speed: Average speed in grid cell (M/S)
  - mean_range: Average range in grid cell (Meters)
  - first_seen: First timestamp in grid cell
  - last_seen: Last timestamp in grid cell
  - n_points: Number of GPS points in grid cell
}
\description{
This function processes GPS track data into a spatial grid summary, calculating time spent
and other metrics for each grid cell. The grid size can be specified to analyze spatial
patterns at different scales.
}
\details{
The function creates a grid by rounding coordinates based on the specified grid size.
Grid sizes are approximate due to the conversion from meters to degrees, with calculations
based on 1 degree â‰ˆ 111km at the equator. Time spent is calculated using the time
differences between consecutive points.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Process tracks with 500m grid (default)
result_500m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data)

# Use 100m grid for finer resolution
result_100m <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 100)

# Use 1km grid for broader patterns
result_1km <- preprocess_track_data(tracks_data, grid_size = 1000)
}
